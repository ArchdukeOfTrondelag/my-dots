This is the collection of my dotfiles
I will try to document it and give usefull comments
Please tell me if somethings missing or you have improvements
This is a side project, so give your thoughts as you wish

I have my own small file manager script that uses fzf as a ui to do stuff, look at the commands with rfc or rgf pick
For nix users i have a small nix part here, type rgf pick to open the general picker or rgf nix to open the nix related options.

I would like to credit Krak9n for the [fetch](https://github.com/Krak9n/rottedfetch). There is an alias, fetch. try it.
